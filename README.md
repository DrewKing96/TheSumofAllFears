# TheSumofAllFears
A simple program to determine if the sum of any two numbers from a list equates to the number n

Given a list of numbers and a number n, return any two numbers from the list that add up to n. For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and n of 17, return 'true' since <em>10+7=17</em>. The initial list to be used is [10, 15, 3, 7], however you may create a random list by pressing the Random List button. You may enter a value for n below, or generate a random n value by pressing the Random Number button.
